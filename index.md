Unbiased analysis of integrated data with Seurat.

The first half of this workflow will:
- Create piecharts on celltype distributions
- Visualize cellcycle scoring on celltypes
- Visualize correlations in gene expression between two groups
- Find correlated networks of protiens that differ in celltypes between two groups using stringDB v10.0
- 
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site

The second half of this workflow will:
- Integrate and recluster celltypes in order to investigate changes on a more granular level
- Visualize cellcycle scoring on celltypes
- Visualize correlations in gene expression between two groups
- Find correlated networks of protiens that differ in celltypes between two groups using stringDB v10.0

The [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial, for those who just want to
get going immediately with a simple site. To some readers, what GitHub
has might be simpler and more direct.  But if you just want to create
a site like the one you're looking at now, read on.

Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).
